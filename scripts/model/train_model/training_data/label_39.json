The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: Huge ruckus downtown. Reports say there was a fight, then shootin. Detectve Jake Morales was first. had coffee in hand, almost spilled it. Next was sergnt Lilly Turner, rollin eyes at Jake. Lieutnant Drake seemed highstrung, kept pacing. Then cptain Marcus Lee yelled out, 'Keep it together!'. Pathrol officer Rob, he likes bein called Rob, was busy gatherin crowd statements. technitian Mikey tryna figure out why their old tech gear ain't workin. in the nearby cafe, oficer Sofia & detectve Monica argued over spilled tea. DOCUMENTS EVERYWHERE; Metropolitan PD file, ID: 7890. Saw a half-torn note by Sergeant Nia. It was kinda wet, and ink was smudged. Cornor Dr. Raj had an interesting theory bout the cause of death. but he spoke so low, hardly anyone heard. Two blocks away, Detectve Ronnie and Technitian Elsie found a weird piece of tech. not sure where it belongs. Meanwhile, Depity Ryan was clueless as always, wondering where his horse was. yes, horse. Don't ask."
