The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: The crime scene was first assessed by Detective Kline who noted multiple points of forced entry. At 14:34, Officer Jameson reported the recovery of a firearm in the bushes near the back entrance, suspecting it t0 be the murder weapon. Meanwhile, Technician Arnold processed the fingerprints found on the window sill, which later turned out to be a match for the suspect identified as John Doe. At the same time, Sergeant Lutz coordinated with the K-9 unit to search the surrounding area for addit1onal clues or evidence that might have been discarded. Lieutenant Park oversaw the entire operation, ensuring all procedures were followed to the letter. Deputy Chief Harmon arrived later to review the progress of the investigation. Officer Daniels and Officer Kieth were tasked with canvassing the neighborhood for any potential witnesses, while Criminalist Dr. Shawcross performed a preliminary analysis of the ballistics evidence. Coroner Dr. Reynolds was called to the scene to examine the body and determine the cause of death. Captain Rodriguez was briefed on the situation by Lieutenant Park and decided to hold a press conference to address the growing public concern. The crime scene log was maintained by Technician O'Neal who recorded all personnel movements in and out of the designated area. Finally, Detective Moreno took statements from the individuals detained nearby who were later cleared of any involvement."
