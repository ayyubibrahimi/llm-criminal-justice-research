The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: Investigatr Lewis arrived at the crime scene at 12:31am. Accompanyed by Chauffer Rodney Robinson, they proceeded to move the decedent's body into a body bag. Subsequently, a single spent casing was found in the pool of bl00d where the body had been. Technician Muh4mmad documented and collected the casing, later identified as a 'Win' 9mm Luger. The incident, a home invasion, left two eyewitnesses, Darceleen Commodore and Earlitta Taylor, inside at the t!me of the shooting. Sergeant McMullen briefed Detective M0rton on a blood trail leading from the hallway to North Derbignay Street. Detective Morton noted the trail, then entered the bedroom to find a woman unresponsive and bleeding on the floor. The witness reported that Gordon threatened her life if the police arrived. Both intruders fled without taking any valuables. At approximately 2:30AM, Crime Lab Technician Tamika Rogers performed a gunshot residue test on both witnesses at the Homicide Office. The Coroner's Office, through Detective David Trehan, l4belled the deaths of Patrice Commodore and Jessie Bibbins as homicides. Detective Morton followed up with Darceleen Commodore at 9:00AM, discussing her encounter with Reynell Payne. Commodore was pressured by Payne to state her son was not involved and to blame an older individual. Detective Morton and Orlando Mathews conducted interviews at the Homicide Office. They compiled photographic line-ups of the suspects, which were presented to the witnesses. Detective Morton also received relevant documents, including a crime scene report containing photographs, a scene sketch, and evidence receipts. Detective Ryan Aucoin led the Crime Lab in processing the scene, instructing the placement of evidence markers and the inclusion of a broken doorjamb in the sketch. The evidence was meticulously recorded and collected. Units on the scene included Detective Sergeant Chris Robert, Officer Juan Lopez, Officers Phil Burras & Quincy Broaden, Officers Nate Addison & Glen Hewitt, Detective Gregory Johnson, Detective Jason McGee, Detective Ananie Mitchell, and Detective Melvin McCullum. Detective Pratt took over a related scene on Mazant Street. The crime scene was later visited by Orleans Parish Coroner's Office Investigator Parnell Williams."
