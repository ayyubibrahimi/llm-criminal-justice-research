The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: In the early h0urs of the m0rning, a distress call was received at the precinct. Officer J0hnathan Miller responded to the call, arriving at the scene at approximately 03:15 AM. The front d00r was slightly ajar and upon entering, he n0ticed signs of 4 forced entry. Detective Sarah Conn0rs was already on-site, analyzing the disrupted state of the living room. She had c0llected several pieces of evidence including a torn p1ece of fabric and a set of fingerprints that were later identified as belonging to the suspect, Mark Jenn1ngs. Crime Lab Technician Emily T0mkins, arrived shortly after and took over the processing of the crime scene. She docum3nted various items that were out of place and seemed to be missing, suggesting a possible burglary. Sergeant L0uis Patterson reported that the neighborhood had seen a recent uptick in similar incidents and that extra patrols would be implemented in the area. Lieutenant Greg0ry Simmons was in charge of coordinating the investigative efforts and held a briefing at 05:00 AM with all the officers involved to discuss the next steps. A statem3nt from the c0roner's office, which was signed by Dr. Michael Harris, indicated that the time of death was likely between midnight and 02:00 AM, narrowing down the window for the crime. As the sun r0se, Captain Elaine Merc3r arrived to oversee the progress and ensure all protocols were being followed. Patrol Officer Tanya Gibs0n was tasked with canvassing the neighborhood to gather any potential witness statements or surveillance footage that could assist in the investigation."        },        {            "role": "user",            "content": "Identify each individual in the transcript, by name, who are directly referred to as officers, sergeants, lieutenants, captains, detectives, homicide officers, and crime lab personnel."        },        {            "role": "assistant",            "content": "Officer Name: Officer Johnathan MillerOfficer Context: Responded to a distress call and arrived at the crime scene, noticing signs of a forced entry.Officer Role: First ResponderOfficer Name: Detective Sarah ConnorsOfficer Context: Was already on-site before Officer Miller, collecting evidence, including a torn piece of fabric and fingerprints.Officer Role: Crime Scene InvestigatorOfficer Name: Crime Lab Technician Emily TomkinsOfficer Context: Arrived shortly after Officer Miller and took over the processing of the crime scene.Officer Role: Crime Scene TechnicianOfficer Name: Sergeant Louis PattersonOfficer Context: Reported an increase in similar incidents in the neighborhood and planned for extra patrols.Officer Role: SergeantOfficer Name: Lieutenant Gregory SimmonsOfficer Context: Coordinated the investigative efforts and led a briefing to discuss the next steps.Officer Role: Investigative CoordinatorOfficer Name: Dr. Michael HarrisOfficer Context: Provided a statement from the coroner's office indicating the estimated time of death.Officer Role: CoronerOfficer Name: Captain Elaine MercerOfficer Context: Arrived to oversee the progress of the investigation and ensure all protocols were being followed.Officer Role: CaptainOfficer Name: Patrol Officer Tanya GibsonOfficer Context: Was tasked with canvassing the neighborhood for potential witness statements or surveillance footage.Officer Role: Patrol Officer"        }    ]}
