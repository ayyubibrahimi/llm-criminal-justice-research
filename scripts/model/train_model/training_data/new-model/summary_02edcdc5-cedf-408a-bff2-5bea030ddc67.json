The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: On the morning of Febru4ry 27th, a 911 call was received regarding a disturbance at 7428 East Maple Str. Sergeant O'Malley arrived first on the $cene, finding the front d00r ajar. Inside, Officer Daniels and Officer Parez were already engaging with the suspect, who was later identified as James T. Krieger. The initial report suggested that Krieger was creating a disturbance over a custody dispute with his ex-wife. Detective Simmons arrived shortly after to take over the lead in questioning Krieger and to assess the situation further. During the search of the premises, Criminalist Dr. Jensen discovered what appeared to b3 a small bag of white powder hidden behind a family photograph in the living room. Coroner Dr. Li was called to the scene when Krieger collapsed unexpectedly during the interrogation. Despite resuscitation efforts by Officer Parez, Krieger was pronounced dead at the scene. An autopsy schedu1ed for later today will be conducted by Coroner Dr. Li to determine the cause of death. Meanwhile, Technician Harper is tasked with analyzing the white powder for any illicit substances. The custody dispute appears to be the motive for the disturbance, but the investigation is ongoing. Officer Parez, who is trained in crisis negotiation, attempted to de-escalate the situation upon arrival. However, the suspect's behavior was erratic, and he did not respond to verbal commands. Patr0l Officer Nash responded to the backup request and assisted in securing the perimeter, ensuring no one else entered the residence during the incident."    },    {      "role": "user",      "content": "Identify each individual in the transcript, by name, who are directly referred to as officers, sergeants, lieutenants, captains, detectives, homicide officers, and crime lab personnel."    },    {      "role": "assistant",      "content": "Officer Name: Sergeant O'MalleyOfficer Context: First to arrive at the scene of the disturbance.Officer Role: SergeantOfficer Name: Officer DanielsOfficer Context: Already engaging with the suspect at the disturbance site upon Sergeant O'Malley's arrival.Officer Role: OfficerOfficer Name: Officer ParezOfficer Context: Was assisting Officer Daniels with the suspect and attempted resuscitation on the suspect after he collapsed.Officer Role: OfficerOfficer Name: Detective SimmonsOfficer Context: Arrived to take over the lead in questioning the suspect and to assess the situation further.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Criminalist Dr. JensenOfficer Context: Discovered a small bag of white powder hidden behind a family photograph in the living room during the search of the premises.Officer Role: CriminalistOfficer Name: Coroner Dr. LiOfficer Context: Called to the scene when the suspect collapsed and pronounced the suspect dead at the scene.
