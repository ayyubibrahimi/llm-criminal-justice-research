Officer Blake, on regular patrol in Wynwood, was among the first to notice the stolen vehicle. Accompanied by Sgt. Lisa Thompson and Patrol Officer Davis, they coordinated an initial search. Technician Murphy, adept in vehicle forensics, was tasked with analyzing the car. Criminalist Edwards, meticulously examining the available evidence, identified a unique tool mark that was key in tracing the vehicle's history. Coroner Dr. Foster was consulted to examine an unrelated case in the vicinity, which unexpectedly yielded information crucial to the auto theft case.
