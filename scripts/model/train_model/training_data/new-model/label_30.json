Palmer Sgt. P. Q. Ross Technician Veronica  DETAILS: On the evening of November 5, Det. D. E. Robinson was alerted to a potential smuggling operation at the city port. This information came from two key informants: Mr. Lopez, a dock worker, and Ms. Bennett, a customs officer.  Mr. Lopez reported witnessing suspicious activities related to cargo movements in and around the port area. Ms. Bennett provided insight into irregularities found within shipping manifests that didn't match up with what was expected.  Technician Veronica was tasked with cross-referencing these manifests against the official records, which led to the discovery of inconsistencies in the shipping details.  By 5:30 PM, a collective effort between Detectives Robinson, Jones, Lambert, and under the supervision of Lt. Stevens pinpointed three containers that could potentially hold contraband. With authorization from Captain L. M. Newton, a covert inspection was initiated.  Coordination with port security was managed by Sgt. Palmer and Sgt. Ross. The inspection, completed by 7:45 PM, revealed illegal contraband in two out of the three flagged containers.
