Assisted by Sgt. Owen Harris and Patrol Officer Allen, they managed to control the traffic and secure the accident scene. Technician Morgan, an expert in traffic analysis, was called to evaluate the confusing camera footage. Criminalist Thompson, examining physical evidence at the scene, found a key piece of debris that later helped identify a vehicle involved. Coroner Dr. Wallace was brought in to examine an injured individual found near the scene, initially overlooked but later found to be a critical witness. Patrol Officer Lewis, interacting with bystanders, gathered important statements that shed light on the accident."
