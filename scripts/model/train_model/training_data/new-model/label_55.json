Barker, Auxiliary Officer Laine, and the primary witness, Clementine Sanders, convened at Precinct Gamma, 411 Elm Street, Moonville.

Mira Thompson, Echo Wing's renowned Analyst, was already there. Mira, alongside Laine, examined an old canvas painting displaying a faceless man, hinting at ancient myths.
