Officer Mitchell, patrolling Franklin Park, was the first to respond to the environmental incident. He was aided by Sgt. Derek Brown and Patrol Officer Simmons, who secured the park area. Technician Harris, specializing in ecological forensics, was brought in to assess the impact. Criminalist Allen, thoroughly examining the environmental samples, identified pollutants that were crucial in tracing the source. Coroner Dr. Martinez was consulted to examine a wildlife casualty, which unexpectedly provided key leads to the environmental crime. Patrol Officer Gomez, interacting with park visitors, collected observations that were essential in piecing together the events leading to the incident."
