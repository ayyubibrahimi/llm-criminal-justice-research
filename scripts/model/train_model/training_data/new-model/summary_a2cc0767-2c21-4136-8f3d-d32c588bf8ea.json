The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: Durtng the late hours of a chilling November evening, Detective Kellie O'Malley and her partner, Sergeant Marko Ruzic, arrived at the desolate crime scene. A broken b0dy was found sprawled across the dilapidated hallway of what appeared to be an abandoned warehouse. Officer Name: Officer Emilio Sanchez, who was the first to respond, reported hearing faint wh1spers before discovering the victim. The coroner's rep0rt, prepared by Dr. Simone Langley, suggested the t1me of death was approximately 3 hours prior to the officers' arrival. In a nearby room, Criminalist Jenna H0dgkins identified a series of latent fingerprints on a shattered p1ece of glass. Technician Liam O'Reilly, working alongside Detective O'Malley, carefully collected the fragmented evidence. A strange symbol was etched into the wall next to where the body was found, which Sergeant Ruzic noted in his report. Deputy Marcus Flint was tasked with interviewing locals who might have seen or heard something on the night of the incident. The investigation was further complicated by the appearance of an encrypted drive found in the pocket of the deceased by Patrol Officer Gabriela Liu. Forensic analysis of the device was assigned to Dr. Alexei Volkov, a renowned expert in cryptology."    },    {      "role": "user",      "content": "Identify each individual in the transcript, by name, who are directly referred to as officers, sergeants, lieutenants, captains, detectives, homicide officers, and crime lab personnel."    },    {      "role": "assistant",      "content": "Officer Name: Detective Kellie O'MalleyOfficer Context: Arrived at the crime scene and worked alongside Technician Liam O'Reilly to collect evidence.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Sergeant Marko RuzicOfficer Context: Noted a strange symbol etched into the wall next to the body in his report.Officer Role: SergeantOfficer Name: Officer Emilio SanchezOfficer Context: First to respond to the crime scene and reported hearing faint whispers before discovering the victim.Officer Role: OfficerOfficer Name: Dr. Simone LangleyOfficer Context: Prepared the coroner's report suggesting the time of death was approximately 3 hours prior to the officers' arrival.Officer Role: CoronerOfficer Name: Criminalist Jenna HodgkinsOfficer Context: Identified a series of latent fingerprints on a shattered piece of glass.Officer Role: CriminalistOfficer Name: Technician Liam O'ReillyOfficer Context: Worked alongside Detective O'Malley to collect the fragmented evidence.Officer Role: TechnicianOfficer Name: Deputy Marcus FlintOfficer Context: Tasked with interviewing locals regarding the incident on the night of the crime.Officer Role: DeputyOfficer Name: Patrol Officer Gabriela LiuOfficer Context: Found an encrypted drive in the pocket of the deceased.Officer Role: Patrol OfficerOfficer Name: Dr. Alexei VolkovOfficer Context: Assigned to perform forensic analysis of the encrypted drive found on the victim.Officer Role: Forensic Expert"    }  ]}
