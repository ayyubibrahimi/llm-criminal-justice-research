The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: Investigator Lew!s and Chauffer Rodney Robinson arrived at the scene at 12:31am to assess the situation. They promptly discovered the victim and called for Technician Muhammad to collect evidence. Muhammad arrived, snapping photos and gathering a spent casing, identified as a "Win" 9mm Luger. The nearby area was combed for additional clues by Sergeant McMullen, who briefed Detective Morton on the findings. Detective Morton then proceeded to oversee the collection of evidence by Crime Lab Technician Tamika Rogers, who conducted gunshot residue tests on the eyewitnesses, Darceleen Commodore and Earlitta Taylor. The Coroner's Office, represented by Dr. David Trehan, later declared the incident a double homicide. Detective Aucoin, after finding a set of keys, secured the crime scene, leaving it marked by the Orleans Parish Coroner's Office. Further investigation led Detective Morton to interview Darceleen Commodore, who identified one Kendall Gordon as an assailant, with a 90% certainty. Detective Pratt and Detective Mathews compiled photographic line-ups to aid the eyewitnesses' recollection. Officers Phil Burras & Quincy Broaden, Nate Addison & Glen Hewitt, and Detective Gregory Johnson, along with Detective Jason McGee and Detective Ananie Mitchell were dispatched to assist. Detective Melvin McCullum was later tasked with handling a related scene. The detailed work of Scientific Criminal Investigations Division Officer Gary Sallienger was crucial in documenting the scene. Detectives Venezia and Gebbia took over the interviews, with Sergeant Townsend managing the crime scene operations, and Sergeant Ruiz coordinating the investigative efforts."        },        {            "role": "user",            "content": "Identify each individual in the transcript, by name, who are directly referred to as officers, sergeants, lieutenants, captains, detectives, homicide officers, and crime lab personnel."        },        {            "role": "assistant",            "content": "Officer Name: Investigator LewisOfficer Context: Arrived at the scene to assess the situation and discovered the victim.Officer Role: InvestigatorOfficer Name: Chauffer Rodney RobinsonOfficer Context: Assisted Investigator Lewis at the scene.Officer Role: ChaufferOfficer Name: Technician MuhammadOfficer Context: Collected evidence, including photographing and gathering a spent casing.Officer Role: TechnicianOfficer Name: Sergeant McMullenOfficer Context: Combed the nearby area for additional clues and briefed Detective Morton.Officer Role: SergeantOfficer Name: Detective MortonOfficer Context: Oversaw the collection of evidence and conducted interviews with eyewitnesses.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Crime Lab Technician Tamika RogersOfficer Context: Conducted gunshot residue tests on eyewitnesses Darceleen Commodore and Earlitta Taylor.Officer Role: Crime Lab TechnicianOfficer Name: Dr. David TrehanOfficer Context: Represented the Coroner's Office and declared the incident a double homicide.Officer Role: CoronerOfficer Name: Detective AucoinOfficer Context: Found a set of keys and secured the crime scene.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Detective PrattOfficer Context: Compiled photographic line-ups to aid eyewitnesses' recollection.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Detective MathewsOfficer Context: Worked with Detective Pratt on photographic line-ups for eyewitnesses.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Officer Phil BurrasOfficer Context: Dispatched to assist with the investigation.Officer Role: OfficerOfficer Name: Officer Quincy BroadenOfficer Context: Paired with Officer Phil Burras to assist with the investigation.Officer Role: OfficerOfficer Name: Officer Nate AddisonOfficer Context: Dispatched to assist with the investigation.Officer Role: OfficerOfficer Name: Officer Glen HewittOfficer Context: Paired with Officer Nate Addison to assist with the investigation.Officer Role: OfficerOfficer Name: Detective Gregory JohnsonOfficer Context: Dispatched to assist with the investigation.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Detective Jason McGeeOfficer Context: Dispatched to assist with the investigation.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Detective Ananie MitchellOfficer Context: Dispatched to assist with the investigation.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Detective Melvin McCullumOfficer Context: Tasked with handling a related scene.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Officer Gary SalliengerOfficer Context: Documented the scene as part of the Scientific Criminal Investigations Division.Officer Role: OfficerOfficer Name: Detective VeneziaOfficer Context: Took over interviews with Detective Gebbia.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Detective GebbiaOfficer Context: Worked with Detective Venezia on conducting interviews.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Sergeant TownsendOfficer Context: Managed the crime scene operations.Officer Role: SergeantOfficer Name: Sergeant RuizOfficer Context: Coordinated the overall investigative efforts.Officer Role: Sergeant"        }    ]}
