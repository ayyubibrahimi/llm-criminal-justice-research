The fire was brought under control by local fire units, but suspicions arose regarding the cause of the blaze, leading to law enforcement involvement.  LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE:  INITIAL REPORT: Deputy X. Y. Z. Warner received a call from the fire department and was the first on the scene. He relayed necessary information to the local precinct, requesting investigative backup. SCENE SAFETY & EVIDENCE PRESERVATION: Sergeant A. B. C. Mendoza coordinated efforts to keep onlookers and media at a safe distance while preserving the integrity of the potential crime scene. FIRE INVESTIGATION: Detective D. E. F. Lawson, with expertise in fire-related crimes, was dispatched to determine if the fire was an act of arson. WITNESS INTERVIEWS: Detective G. H. I. Rodriguez took statements from the Manor's staff, neighbors, and the attending fire personnel. FORENSIC SUPPORT: Criminalist J. K. L. Vargas collected samples from the origin points of the fire for chemical analysis. Technician M. N. O. Riley reviewed surveillance footage from neighboring properties for any suspicious activity. MEDICAL EVALUATION: Dr. P. Q. R. Hamilton, specializing in burn injuries, was consulted regarding the injuries sustained by two of the Manor's staff, providing insights into the fire's progression and intensity. Sgt. Mendoza's efforts prevented contamination of the scene, and Detective Lawson quickly deduced multiple origin points, suggesting arson. Detective Rodriguez's interviews uncovered a disgruntled former employee with a potential motive. Criminalist Vargas's lab results found traces of accelerants, and Technician Riley identified a suspicious individual near the manor shortly before the fire. Dr. Hamilton's medical evaluation further supported the arson theory.
