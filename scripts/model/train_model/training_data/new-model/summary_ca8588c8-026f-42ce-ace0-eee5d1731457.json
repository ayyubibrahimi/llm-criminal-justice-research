The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: At the crime scene, S3rgeant Bradley was the first to arrive, followed by Off1cer Lannigan who began to secure the perimeter. Detective M0rales and his partner, Detective C0sta, arrived at approximately 10:15 PM and took over the investigation from the uniformed officers on site. Crime Lab Technician Sanchez and Coroner Dr. Kimball were summoned to process the scene. Lieutenant Baker arrived later to supervise the operations. There was some confusion when Detective O'Reilly, who was on sick leave, showed up unexpectedly claiming he had important information regarding the case. The officers at the scene were able to verify that Detective O'Reilly's insights were valuable to the investigation. Officer Patterson, who was patrolling the nearby area, heard the dispatch and arrived to offer assistance, as did Deputy Markham from the neighboring county. Technician Riley was tasked with collecting ballistic evidence, and along with Criminalist Dr. Reyes, they worked meticulously to catalog every piece of evidence. In the midst of the chaos, Officer Renaldi reported seeing a suspicious individual fleeing the scene, but due to the lack of visibility, the description provided was vague. Captain Stone coordinated the efforts of the responding units and ensured that the chain of command was maintained throughout the incident."        },        {            "role": "user",            "content": "Identify each individual in the transcript, by name, who are directly referred to as officers, sergeants, lieutenants, captains, detectives, homicide officers, and crime lab personnel."        },        {            "role": "assistant",            "content": "Officer Name: Sergeant BradleyOfficer Context: First to arrive at the crime scene.Officer Role: SergeantOfficer Name: Officer LanniganOfficer Context: Secured the perimeter upon arrival at the crime scene.Officer Role: OfficerOfficer Name: Detective MoralesOfficer Context: Along with his partner, took over the investigation from the uniformed officers on site.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Detective CostaOfficer Context: Partnered with Detective Morales, took charge of the investigation.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Technician SanchezOfficer Context: Summoned to process the crime scene.Officer Role: Crime Lab TechnicianOfficer Name: Dr. KimballOfficer Context: Summoned as the coroner to process the crime scene.Officer Role: CoronerOfficer Name: Lieutenant BakerOfficer Context: Arrived to supervise the operations at the crime scene.Officer Role: LieutenantOfficer Name: Detective O'ReillyOfficer Context: Showed up unexpectedly at the crime scene while on sick leave, claiming to have important information regarding the case.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Officer PattersonOfficer Context: Arrived to offer assistance after hearing the dispatch while patrolling nearby.Officer Role: OfficerOfficer Name: Deputy MarkhamOfficer Context: From the neighboring county, arrived at the crime scene to offer assistance.Officer Role: DeputyOfficer Name: Technician RileyOfficer Context: Tasked with collecting ballistic evidence at the crime scene.Officer Role: TechnicianOfficer Name: Dr. ReyesOfficer Context: Worked alongside Technician Riley to catalog every piece of evidence meticulously.Officer Role: CriminalistOfficer Name: Officer RenaldiOfficer Context: Reported seeing a suspicious individual fleeing the crime scene.Officer Role: OfficerOfficer Name: Captain StoneOfficer Context: Coordinated the efforts of the responding units and maintained the chain of command.Officer Role: Captain"        }    ]}
