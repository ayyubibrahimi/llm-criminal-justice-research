I will derive this data from the following paragraph: During the late night hours, Detective Harlan Peck overheard a suspicious c0nversat1on between two known miscreants in the alleyway adjacent to the 5th Precinct. The dialogue seemed to imply a planned heist at the upcoming charity ball scheduled at the Ritz-Carlton. As Detective Peck jotted down notes, Officer Lana Rodriguez approached to investigate the disturbance. She reported the incident to Sergeant Avery Connors, who was monitoring the security cameras nearby. The sergeant alerted the patrol units in the area to be vigilant. At approximately 02:47 AM, Lieutenant Jackson Hughes reviewed the surveillance footage to corroborate the officer's statements. The lieutenant noted that a white van, with the license plate partially obscured, seemed to be idling suspiciously near the service entrance of the hotel. Meanwhile, Deputy Evan Murphy, assigned to the K-9 unit, was conducting a perimeter check when his dog, Boomer, signaled towards a breach in the fencing surrounding the property. Coroner Dr. Simone Fields was on-site responding to an unrelated matter when she overheard the chatter about the potential security threat and offered her assistance. Technician Eliza Gomez was dispatched to enhance the video quality of the surveillance footage for clearer identification of the suspects. The Criminalist team, led by Dr. Owen Harper, was preparing their forensic kits in case any physical evidence was discovered on the scene."    },    {      "role": "user",      "content": "Identify each individual in the transcript, by name, who are directly referred to as officers, sergeants, lieutenants, captains, detectives, homicide officers, and crime lab personnel."    },    {      "role": "assistant",      "content": "Officer Name: Detective Harlan PeckOfficer Context: Overheard a suspicious conversation related to a planned heist and took notes.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Officer Lana RodriguezOfficer Context: Approached to investigate a disturbance and reported it.Officer Role: OfficerOfficer Name: Sergeant Avery ConnorsOfficer Context: Was monitoring security cameras and alerted patrol units to be vigilant.Officer Role: SergeantOfficer Name: Lieutenant Jackson HughesOfficer Context: Reviewed surveillance footage to corroborate officers' statements.Officer Role: LieutenantOfficer Name: Deputy Evan MurphyOfficer Context: Conducting a perimeter check with K-9 unit and discovered a breach in the fencing.Officer Role: K-9 Unit DeputyOfficer Name: Coroner Dr. Simone FieldsOfficer Context: Was on-site for an unrelated matter but offered assistance after overhearing chatter about a security threat.Officer Role: CoronerOfficer Name: Technician Eliza GomezOfficer Context: Dispatched to enhance video quality of surveillance footage.Officer Role: TechnicianOfficer Name: Criminalist Dr. Owen HarperOfficer Context: Leading the Criminalist team in preparing forensic kits.Officer Role: Criminalist Lead"    }  ]}
