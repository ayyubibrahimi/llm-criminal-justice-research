The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: At a crime scene on 4th and Maple, it was a cold and rainy night, a typical setting where you expect the unexpected to happen. Sergeant O'Malley was the first to arrive, noticing the scattered debris and the faint sound of a car alarm in the distance. The streetlights were flickering, casting an eerie glow on the scene. Officer Reynolds and Officer Clark were next, securing the perimeter with yellow tape, their breaths visible in the chilling air. Meanwhile, Technician Harper was examining the car wreckage, looking for any signs of the driver or potential evidence. Just as Harper found a peculiarly bent license plate, Lieutenant Carter approached, his boots splashing in the puddles that pockmarked the road. 'Any luck?' he inquired, but before Harper could answer, Detective M0ran0's voice crackled over the radio. 'We have a witness,' she said, her tone indicating she was on the move. 'They saw a red sedan speeding away.' Back at the precinct, Criminalist Jensen was meticulously piecing together the information collected, while Coroner Dr. Price was examining the unfortunate victim who was found several blocks away, a likely hit and run. Captain Ruiz had been overseeing the operations, ensuring every detail was attended to. Suddenly, the radio buzzed again, Patrol Officer L0pez reported spotting a red sedan with a dent on the hood that matched the bent license plate found at the scene. The night was far from over, but the pieces were starting to come together, thanks to the concerted efforts of the law enforcement team."        },        {            "role": "user",            "content": "Identify each individual in the transcript, by name, who are directly referred to as officers, sergeants, lieutenants, captains, detectives, homicide officers, and crime lab personnel."        },        {            "role": "assistant",            "content": "Officer Name: Sergeant O'MalleyOfficer Context: First responder at the crime scene on 4th and Maple.Officer Role: SergeantOfficer Name: Officer ReynoldsOfficer Context: Assisted in securing the perimeter with yellow tape.Officer Role: Police OfficerOfficer Name: Officer ClarkOfficer Context: Assisted in securing the perimeter with yellow tape.Officer Role: Police OfficerOfficer Name: Technician HarperOfficer Context: Examined the car wreckage at the scene.Officer Role: TechnicianOfficer Name: Lieutenant CarterOfficer Context: Approached Technician Harper to inquire about findings at the crime scene.Officer Role: LieutenantOfficer Name: Detective Moran0Officer Context: Reported over the radio about a witness sighting a red sedan speeding away.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Criminalist JensenOfficer Context: Was piecing together information collected from the crime scene.Officer Role: CriminalistOfficer Name: Dr. PriceOfficer Context: Examining the victim of a likely hit and run.Officer Role: CoronerOfficer Name: Captain RuizOfficer Context: Overseeing the operations at the crime scene.Officer Role: CaptainOfficer Name: Patrol Officer LopezOfficer Context: Reported spotting a red sedan that matched evidence from the crime scene.Officer Role: Patrol Officer"        }    ]}
