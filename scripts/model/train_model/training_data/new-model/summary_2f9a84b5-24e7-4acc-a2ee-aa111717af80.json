The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: At approximately 01:45h, Sergeant F0ster and Detective M0r0w responded to a disturbance call at 221B Baker Street. Upon arrival, they encountered a suspect behaving erratically and claim1ng to possess an explos1ve device. Officer N4ncy Drew, a specialist in explosive ordnance disposal, was summoned to assess the threat. After a thorough examination, Officer Drew determined the device to be a rudimentary fake. In the meantime, Technician L1nda B4r0n documented the scene and collected potential evidence, including a suspi6ious package found near the entrance. Further investigation by Detective J0nathan D0e revealed that the suspect, known to the community as 'Crazy Joe', had a history of similar hoaxes. The case was later handed over to Criminal1st Dr. Henry Jekyll, who performed a detailed analysis of the substances found within the suspicious package. His report concluded that the materials were harmless and commonly available household items. Lieutenant J4ne Smith coordinated the interdepartmental efforts during the incident, ensuring smooth communication between the bomb squad, forensic unit, and patrol officers."        },        {            "role": "user",            "content": "Identify each individual in the transcript, by name, who are directly referred to as officers, sergeants, lieutenants, captains, detectives, homicide officers, and crime lab personnel."        },        {            "role": "assistant",            "content": "Officer Name: Sergeant FosterOfficer Context: Responded to a disturbance call at 221B Baker Street with Detective Morrow.Officer Role: SergeantOfficer Name: Detective MorrowOfficer Context: Accompanied Sergeant Foster in responding to the disturbance call at 221B Baker Street.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Officer Nancy DrewOfficer Context: Summoned as a specialist in explosive ordnance disposal to assess a purported explosive device at the scene.Officer Role: Explosive Ordnance Disposal SpecialistOfficer Name: Technician Linda BaronOfficer Context: Documented the scene and collected evidence, including a suspicious package near the entrance.Officer Role: Forensic TechnicianOfficer Name: Detective Jonathan DoeOfficer Context: Investigated the suspect's history and found a pattern of similar hoaxes.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Criminalist Dr. Henry JekyllOfficer Context: Analyzed the substances in the suspicious package and concluded they were harmless household items.Officer Role: CriminalistOfficer Name: Lieutenant Jane SmithOfficer Context: Coordinated interdepartmental efforts during the incident to ensure effective communication.Officer Role: Lieutenant"        }    ]}
