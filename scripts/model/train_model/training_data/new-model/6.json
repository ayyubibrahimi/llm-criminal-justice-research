Together with Sgt. Lucas Moore and Patrol Officer Davis, they managed to secure the perimeter. Technician Wright, specializing in digital evidence analysis, was assigned to decode the murky surveillance footage. Criminalist Thompson, sifting through the collected evidence, located a distinctive ring that later became key in identifying a person of interest.
