The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: At the break of dawn, D3t3ctiv3 Marcus Tiller was the first to arrive at the crime scene. He was soon joined by Sergeant Eliza Cortez, who oversaw the coordination of the investigative efforts. During the initial sweep, Officer Jonathan K3lls picked up what appeared to be a critical piece of evidence, a fragment of a driver's license, which seemed to belong to the victim. Due to the nature of the find, Criminalist Jamie Peterson was called to the scene to assist with the collection and preservation of the evidence. Officer K3lls handed the fragment over to Peterson, who carefully documented the item before placing it into an evidence bag. Meanwhile, Technician Alex R3ed was busy setting up the mobile lab unit, ready to analyze any forensic material gathered. It was not long before Coroner Dr. Emily St3vens arrived to examine the body. After a thorough examination, Dr. St3vens noted that the victim had succumbed to multiple stab wounds, which appeared to be inflicted with a serrated blade. The meticulous work of the coroner's office would prove invaluable in piecing together the events leading to the individual's untimely demise."        },        {            "role": "user",            "content": "Identify each individual in the transcript, by name, who are directly referred to as officers, sergeants, lieutenants, captains, detectives, homicide officers, and crime lab personnel."        },        {            "role": "assistant",            "content": "Officer Name: Detective Marcus TillerOfficer Context: Arrived first at the crime scene.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Sergeant Eliza CortezOfficer Context: Oversaw the coordination of the investigative efforts.Officer Role: SergeantOfficer Name: Officer Jonathan KellsOfficer Context: Discovered a crucial piece of evidence during the initial sweep.Officer Role: OfficerOfficer Name: Criminalist Jamie PetersonOfficer Context: Called to the scene to assist with the collection and preservation of evidence.Officer Role: CriminalistOfficer Name: Technician Alex ReedOfficer Context: Set up the mobile lab unit for forensic analysis.Officer Role: TechnicianOfficer Name: Coroner Dr. Emily StevensOfficer Context: Conducted a thorough examination of the body at the scene.Officer Role: Coroner"        }    ]}
