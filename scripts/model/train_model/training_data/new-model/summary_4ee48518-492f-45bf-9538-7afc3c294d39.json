The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: [The multi-layered investigation commenced with a chaotic crime scene where Detective Sarah Conn0lly and her partner, Officer Jameson Kea1ey, encountered numerous challenges. Their squad car, Unit 547, was the first to arrive following a distress call at approximately 11:47 PM. The residence, riddled with bul1et holes and shattered glass, was eerily silent, with no immediate sign of the occupants. Sergeant Tom Ha1sey, overseeing the operation, instructed the team to preserve the perimeter. As the officers cautiously advanced, they stumbled upon a barely legible, bloodstained note suggesting a struggle. Technician Leah Wa1sh, in her preliminary assessment, speculated that the assailant might have sustained injuries, leaving behind trace evidence. Meanwhile, Criminalist Derek O'Ma1ley examined the ballistic markings, attempting to match them with recent crimes in the database. Nearby, Patrol Officer Mike A1varado was canvassing the neighborhood for witnesses, one of whom provided a blurry cellphone video capturing a suspicious vehicle speeding away. The coroner's van, driven by Dr. Emily Stanto1n, arrived to attend to the victims. Amidst the chaos, Captain Richard Maddo1x coordinated with the central dispatch to alert nearby patrols of the suspected getaway vehicle. Deputy Sheryl Co1eman, who had been on a stakeout in the vicinity, reported a car matching the description heading east on Route 27. The initial findings were documented by Officer Keith Ramsa1y, who noted the position of each shell casing with meticulous precision.]"        },        {            "role": "user",            "content": "Identify each individual in the transcript, by name, who are directly referred to as officers, sergeants, lieutenants, captains, detectives, homicide officers, and crime lab personnel."        },        {            "role": "assistant",            "content": "Officer Name: Detective Sarah Conn0llyOfficer Context: She and her partner were the first to arrive at the chaotic crime scene following a distress call.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Officer Jameson Kea1eyOfficer Context: Partnered with Detective Conn0lly, arrived first at the crime scene.Officer Role: OfficerOfficer Name: Sergeant Tom Ha1seyOfficer Context: Oversaw the operation and instructed the team to preserve the perimeter.Officer Role: SergeantOfficer Name: Technician Leah Wa1shOfficer Context: Speculated that the assailant might have sustained injuries, leaving behind trace evidence.Officer Role: TechnicianOfficer Name: Criminalist Derek O'Ma1leyOfficer Context: Examined the ballistic markings to match them with recent crimes.Officer Role: CriminalistOfficer Name: Patrol Officer Mike A1varadoOfficer Context: Canvassed the neighborhood for witnesses who captured a suspicious vehicle on video.Officer Role: Patrol OfficerOfficer Name: Dr. Emily Stanto1nOfficer Context: Arrived at the scene to attend to the victims.Officer Role: CoronerOfficer Name: Captain Richard Maddo1xOfficer Context: Coordinated with central dispatch regarding the suspected getaway vehicle.Officer Role: CaptainOfficer Name: Deputy Sheryl Co1emanOfficer Context: Reported a car matching the description of the suspect's vehicle heading east on Route 27.Officer Role: DeputyOfficer Name: Officer Keith Ramsa1yOfficer Context: Documented the position of each shell casing with precision.Officer Role: Officer"        }    ]}
