The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: On the m0rning of April 5th, D3puty Marcus Brown arrived at the scene of the incident alongside Sergeant E1aine Roberts. The reported incident took place at a convenience st0re at the c0rner of Maple and 5th Avenue. Upon arriving, Officer Antonella Rodriguez began securing the perimeter with yellow tape and documenting witness statements. Officer Rodriguez noted that a suspect, identified as Michael Thompson, had fled the scene prior to police arrival. Detective Jaxon Tyler and his partner, Officer Kaitlyn Reed, entered the st0re to review surveillance footage. The cashier, visibly shaken, directed them to the back room where the storeâ€™s security system was housed. Criminalist Dr. Steven Clark examined the footage and determined the suspect's height and weight. The suspect was approximately 6 feet tall and weighed around 180 pounds. Technici4n Leah Kim was tasked with collecting any potential evidence, such as fingerprints or DNA samples, left behind by the suspect. Meanwhile, outside the store, Coroner Dr. Emily Nguyen was examining the body of the victim, who had suffered multiple gunshot wounds. The cor0ner's preliminary assessment indicated that the victim had not survived the attack. Nearby, Officer Gregory Hayes was interviewing bystanders to gather additional information. Lieutenant Carson Blake took command of the situation, instructing officers to canvass the area in search of the suspect and any other potential witnesses or evidence."        },        {            "role": "user",            "content": "Identify each individual in the transcript, by name, who are directly referred to as officers, sergeants, lieutenants, captains, detectives, homicide officers, and crime lab personnel."        },        {            "role": "assistant",            "content": "Officer Name: Deputy Marcus BrownOfficer Context: Arrived at the scene of the incident at a convenience store.Officer Role: DeputyOfficer Name: Sergeant Elaine RobertsOfficer Context: Arrived at the scene with Deputy Marcus Brown.Officer Role: SergeantOfficer Name: Officer Antonella RodriguezOfficer Context: Began securing the perimeter with yellow tape and documenting witness statements.Officer Role: OfficerOfficer Name: Detective Jaxon TylerOfficer Context: Entered the store to review surveillance footage.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Officer Kaitlyn ReedOfficer Context: Partner of Detective Jaxon Tyler, entered the store to review surveillance footage.Officer Role: OfficerOfficer Name: Criminalist Dr. Steven ClarkOfficer Context: Examined the surveillance footage to determine the suspect's height and weight.Officer Role: CriminalistOfficer Name: Technician Leah KimOfficer Context: Tasked with collecting potential evidence such as fingerprints or DNA samples.Officer Role: TechnicianOfficer Name: Coroner Dr. Emily NguyenOfficer Context: Examined the body of the victim who suffered multiple gunshot wounds.Officer Role: CoronerOfficer Name: Officer Gregory HayesOfficer Context: Interviewing bystanders to gather additional information.Officer Role: OfficerOfficer Name: Lieutenant Carson BlakeOfficer Context: Took command of the situation, instructing officers to canvass the area.Officer Role: Lieutenant"        }    ]}
