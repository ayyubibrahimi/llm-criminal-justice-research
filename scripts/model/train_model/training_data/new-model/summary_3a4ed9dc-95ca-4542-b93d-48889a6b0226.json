The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: The c4se inv0lving the mysterious disappearance of local business owner Harold Jenkins took an unexpected turn when Officer Patricia O'Neil discovered a hidden compartment behind the bookshelf in Jenkins's office. Inside, she found documents that seemed to p0int to an elaborate embezzlement scheme. Meanwhile, Detective Marcus Reynolds, who had been leading the investigation, was last seen questioning the night guard, Dave Simm0ns, who worked the evening Jenkins was last seen. Simm0ns mentioned seeing a suspici0us vehicle parked outside the premises but couldn't provide a license plate number. Sergeant Liam O'Connor was tasked with reviewing the surveillance tapes from the surrounding area to identify the vehicle. During the process, Technician Emily Watson encountered an issue with the playback equipment, causing a delay in the review. Further complicating matters, Deputy Ryan Booker reported that two witnesses came forward, claiming they saw Jenkins leaving his office with an unidentified individual on the night in question. The witnesses, identified as Coroner Dr. Elizabeth Shaw and Crimin4list James Peterson, provided statements that they saw Jenkins looking distressed. Lieutenant Gregory Hayes was notified of these developments and decided to increase patrols in the area as a precaution.
