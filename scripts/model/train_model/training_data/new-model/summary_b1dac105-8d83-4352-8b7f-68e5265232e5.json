The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: Investigator Lewis and Chauffeur Rodney Robinson were first on the scene, arriving promptly at 12:31am. They discovered the victim lying in a pool of blood and proceeded to roll her over and place her in a body bag. A single spent casing was found beneath the body, which Technician Muhammad documented and collected at precisely the same time. The casing was later identified as a 'Win' 9mm Luger. The crime occurred during a home invasion, with eyewitnesses Darceleen Commodore and Earlitta Taylor present at the time of the shooting. They were subsequently taken to the Homicide Office for further questioning. Sergeant McMullen briefed Detective Morton on the blood trail from the hallway to North Derbignay Street. Detective Morton surveyed the scene, noting the specific details for his report. During the early hours, at 2:30AM, Crime Lab Technician Tamika Rogers conducted gunshot residue tests on the eyewitnesses. Coroner's Office Day Records, signed off by Detective David Trehan, declared the deaths of Patrice Commodore and Jessie Bibbins as homicides. Detective Morton then interviewed Darceleen Commodore regarding her altercation with Reynell Payne, who had attempted to coerce her into misidentifying the perpetrator. Detective Aucoin was also involved, having located a set of keys and securing the crime scene thereafter. The following morning, Detective Morton requested and received a communication log from the command desk, which included an audio recording of all relevant transmissions. He cross-referenced this with the Fifth District Incident Report, finding consistency with the evidence. Detective Ryan Aucoin, leading the Crime Lab team, directed the marking of the blood trail and the inclusion of a broken doorjamb in the scene sketch. Furthermore, the team was overseen by Detective Sergeant Chris Robert and included Officers Juan Lopez, Phil Burras, Quincy Broaden, Nate Addison, Glen Hewitt, and Detectives Gregory Johnson, Jason McGee, Ananie Mitchell, and Melvin McCullum. Detective Pratt of the Homicide Section managed a separate scene. Detective Mathews and Orlando Mathews conducted interviews and collated photographic line-ups for witness identification. Scientific Criminal Investigations Division Officer Gary Sallienger supported the scene sketching efforts. Detective Morton later continued the interviews and identification processes with the help of the photographic evidence."    },    {      "role": "user",      "content": "Identify each individual in the transcript, by name, who are directly referred to as officers, sergeants, lieutenants, captains, detectives, homicide officers, and crime lab personnel."    },    {      "role": "assistant",      "content": "Officer Name: Investigator LewisOfficer Context: Arrived at the crime scene and assisted in rolling the victim over and placing her in a body bag.Officer Role: InvestigatorOfficer Name: Chauffeur Rodney RobinsonOfficer Context: Assisted Investigator Lewis at the crime scene.Officer Role: ChauffeurOfficer Name: Technician MuhammadOfficer Context: Documented and collected the spent casing found beneath the victim's body.Officer Role: TechnicianOfficer Name: Sergeant McMullenOfficer Context: Briefed Detective Morton on the blood trail found at the crime scene.Officer Role: SergeantOfficer Name: Detective MortonOfficer Context: Surveyed the crime scene, received a briefing from Sergeant McMullen, and later interviewed eyewitness Darceleen Commodore.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Crime Lab Technician Tamika RogersOfficer Context: Conducted gunshot residue tests on the eyewitnesses at the Homicide Office.Officer Role: Crime Lab TechnicianOfficer Name: Detective David TrehanOfficer Context: Signed off on Coroner's Office Day Records that declared the deaths as homicides.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Detective AucoinOfficer Context: Located a set of keys at the crime scene, secured the scene, and directed the Crime Lab team.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Detective Sergeant Chris RobertOfficer Context: Oversaw the Crime Lab team that included several officers and detectives.Officer Role: Detective SergeantOfficer Name: Officer Juan LopezOfficer Context: Mentioned as part of the Crime Lab team.Officer Role: OfficerOfficer Name: Officers Phil Burras & Quincy BroadenOfficer Context: Part of the Crime Lab team.Officer Role: OfficersOfficer Name: Officers Nate Addison & Glen HewittOfficer Context: Part of the Crime Lab team.Officer Role: OfficersOfficer Name: Detective Gregory JohnsonOfficer Context: Part of the Crime Lab team.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Detective Jason McGeeOfficer Context: Part of the Crime Lab team.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Detective Ananie MitchellOfficer Context: Part of the Crime Lab team.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Detective Melvin McCullumOfficer Context: Part of the Crime Lab team.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Detective PrattOfficer Context: Managed a separate crime scene.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Detective Mathews & Orlando MathewsOfficer Context: Conducted interviews and collated photographic line-ups for witness identification.Officer Role: DetectivesOfficer Name: Officer Gary SalliengerOfficer Context: Supported the scene sketching efforts for the Crime Lab.Officer Role: Scientific Criminal Investigations Division Officer"    }  ]}
