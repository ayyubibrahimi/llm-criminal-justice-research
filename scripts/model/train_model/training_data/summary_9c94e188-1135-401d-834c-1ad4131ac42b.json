            "content": "As an AI assistant, my role is to meticulously analyze criminal justice documents and extract information about law enforcement personnel. The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: At the scene, Invest1gator Lewis and Chauffer Rodney Robins0n disc0vered a spent casing in the vicinity where the decedent was located. Technician Muhammad, despite the faint lighting, managed to photograph and secure the casing labeled as a 'Win' 9mm Luger. The incident, which occured at around 11:45pm, involved two key eyewitnesses within the domicile during the events, Darceleen Commodore and Earlitta Taylor. Sergeant McMullen relayed to Detective Morton that a blood trail was evident from the interior hallway to North Derbigny Street. Upon rev1ewing the H-10983-09 report, Detective Morton noted the witness's account of the intruder's threat to commit homicide if law enforcers were to arrive. Subsequently, the offenders fled the premises with neither monetary gains nor vehicular access. The law enforcement's follow-up included Crime Lab Technician Tamika Rogers performing GSR tests on both witnesses at the Homicide Office. Furthermore, Detective David Trehan's records from the Coroner's Office denoted the demises of Patrice Commodore and Jessie Bibbins as homicides. When confronted by Detective Morton, Darceleen Commodore identified Reynell Payne under duress as a non-participant in the events, contrary to her initial assertion. Additional interviews at the Homicide Office by Detective Morton with eyewitnesses yielded a positive identification of Kendall Gordon as one of the assailants by Commodore, who was around 90% certain of her recognition. Detective Aucoin, around 1:00am, pinpointed a set of keys within the lounge area, later securing the residence post-investigation. The subsequent day involved Detective Morton obtaining communication logs pertinent to the case. In the same vein, a comprehensive Crime Scene Report inclusive of photographs, a scene sketch, and evidence catalog was received from the Crime Lab. The processing of the crime scene was executed under the direction of Detective Ryan Aucoin, with evidence markers placed strategically and a broken doorjamb piece sketched into the scene illustration by SciCrim Inv Division Officer Gary Sallienger. Additionally, officers were deployed to various units: Detective Sergeant Chris Roberts to Unit 520, Detective Gregory Johnson to Unit 546, and Detectives Jason McGee, Ananie Mitchell, and Melvin McCullum to Units 1571, 1574, and 1576 respectively. The narrative continued with Detective Pratt of the Homicide Section managing another scene and Detective Mathews assembling photographic line-ups for witness review."
