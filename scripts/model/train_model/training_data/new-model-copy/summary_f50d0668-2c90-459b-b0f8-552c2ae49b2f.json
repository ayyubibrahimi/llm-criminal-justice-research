The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: In the confus10n of the crime scene, Officer Jeremy Watkins and Technician Lisa Monroe worked diligently to secure the perimeter. Meanwhile, Detective Mark Brunell took statements from the witnesses, noting particularly the testimony of an individual who saw a man fleeing the scene. Sergeant Eliza Gomez coordinated the efforts of her squad while patrolling the nearby streets for any suspicious activity. Officer Daniel O'Conner reported finding a discarded weapon in a dumpster, which was later confirmed by the lab to be the murder weapon used in the crime. Deputy Ethan Cole arrived to assist in canvassing the area for more evidence. Lieutenant Harper's detailed notes on the case provided valuable insights into the procedural errors made during the initial response. Captain Avery Johnson oversaw the operation, ensuring all protocols were followed after the early mishaps. Coroner Dr. Emily Stanton pronounced the victim deceased at 3:42 pm, and her assistant, Technician Alex Ramirez, prepared the body for transport. Criminalist Jordan Lee analyzed the recovered weapon and managed to lift partial fingerprints, possibly belonging to the suspect."
