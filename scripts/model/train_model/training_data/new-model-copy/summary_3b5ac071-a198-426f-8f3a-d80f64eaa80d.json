The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: The inves1igation was in full swing when Detective Harlan entered the coffee-stained briefing room. Amid the chaos, Lieutenant G0mez directed the officers to various locations, ensuring that all leads were being pursued. Officer L3slie and Officer Callum had already been dispatched to canvass the neighborhood, while Sergeant V3squ3z was coordinating with the forensics team. A report from Technician Alvarado indicated that there might be a significant fingerprint 0n the murder weapon, and Coroner Dr. Ochoa was on the scene, examining the body for clues. Patrol Officer Morales took detailed notes, her pen flying across the notepad as she recorded every detail that Detective Sergeant Trent was mentioning. The Criminalist, named Dr. Bishop, was analyzing the blood splatter patterns, hoping to piece together the sequence of events. Overhearing this, Coroner's Technician Spencer immediately relayed the information to Deputy Milton, who was guarding the perimeter to prevent evidence contamination. Captain Ramirez, overseeing the operation, commended the team for their diligence and reminded everyone of the importance of securing accurate evidence."
