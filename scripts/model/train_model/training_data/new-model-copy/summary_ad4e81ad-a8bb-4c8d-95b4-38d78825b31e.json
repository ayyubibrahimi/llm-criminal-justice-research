The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: In an unpr3cedented move, Coroner Dr. Simmons was called to the scene at 2:45pm. On arrival, Dr. Simmons announced that, despite the cha0tic scene, a thorough investigation was paramount. Lt. Geraldine Harkness, having coordinated the initial r3sponse, instructed officers to canvass the area for any potential witnesses. The crime scene was bustling with activity as Crime Scene Technician Martin O'Neil meticulously collected evidence. Officer Ryan Booth was later dispatched to follow up on a tip that led to the recovery of a suspicious vehicle, which was promptly taken into evidence by Deputy Samantha Cross. Meanwhile, Sergeant Jack Summers was tasked with reviewing nearby surveillance footage, which revealed a man fitting the suspect's description. Detective Kelly Rizzo interviewed the store clerk, who confirmed the suspect purchased items shortly before the incident occurred. Patrol Officer Lewis Grant reported that the neighborhood is known for illicit activities, which could suggest a motive for the crime. Criminalist Dr. Jamie Tanner analyzed the collected samples, noting a match to a known offender in the database. Technician Emily Stone assisted in processing the digital evidence, while Officer Nicole Harris took witness statements outside the cordoned-off area. Despite the many moving parts, Captain Meredith Grey ensured the investigation proceeded in an orderly fashion."
