The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: On the evening of March 2nd, Det. Sarah O'Conner and her partner Sgt. Jonathan Price were called to a disturbance at 2119 Maple Ave. The report came in at approximately 8:45 PM, when neighbors heard loud noises from the apartment of Mr. Jacob Hensley. Upon arrival, the officers encountered a 50-year-old male, later identified as Mr. Hensley, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol. Officer Don Matthews and Officer Mia Sanchez arrived as backup, with Officer Matthews securing the scene and Officer Sanchez attending to the neighbors' queries. According to the neighbors, Mr. Hensley has a history of erratic behavior, often shouting at 'phantoms' as one neighbor put it. The situation escalated when Mr. Hensley brandished what appeared to be a firearm. Sgt. Price attempted to de-escalate the situation, but Mr. Hensley became more agitated. It was then that Officer Sanchez noticed the weapon was in fact a pellet gun. With this knowledge, Det. O'Conner managed to calm Mr. Hensley down, and he was taken into custody without further incident. A subsequent search by Technician Emily Nguyen revealed the pellet gun and multiple empty liquor bottles. The firearm was logged into evidence by Crmnlst. Lucas Graham, who was later called to process the evidence. Coroner Dr. Henry Wallace was briefly on scene to confirm there were no injuries. Dr. Wallace's presence was a precaution due to Mr. Hensley's advanced age and the officers' initial uncertainty about the firearm."
