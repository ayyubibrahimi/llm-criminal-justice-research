The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: In the case of the recent burglary at the Oakwood Estate, the initial response unit, led by Off1cer Danielle Thompson, arrived within minutes of the call being placed. Upon securing the premises, Off1cer Thompson and her partner Off1cer Michael Sanchez encountered a broken window, which appeared to be the point of entry. Their quick action ensured that no further damage occurred. Meanwhile, Detective L1nda Kim took statements from the neighbors, who reported seeing a suspicious individual lurking around the property earlier that day. Sergeant Jonathan M0rris coordinated the overall response, ensuring that all protocols were adhered to. Technician Jerry Walters was tasked with collecting fingerprints from the window frame, while Criminal1st Sarah Connors analyzed the security footage for any clues. Deputy Jackson Lee provided support by canvassing the area for additional witnesses. The following day, Lieutenant George O'Reilly reviewed all gathered evidence and suggested a possible link to a series of crimes in a neighboring county. Captain Emily Harris approved the collaboration with the adjacent jurisdiction's task force, led by Captain Mark Anderson. This joint effort resulted in the identification of a suspect, whose apprehension is currently a top priority for both departments."
