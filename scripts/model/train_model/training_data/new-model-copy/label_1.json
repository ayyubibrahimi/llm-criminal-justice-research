My appreciation of why I was called is that 10 Mr. Adams had indicated a desire to confess and to 11 implicate Calcagno and Dupard in the Seafood City 12 17 A Mr. Rowan, I can't remember everything. I know there was 18 cash stolen, there was guns stolen, there was a 19 T.

I -- A 23 6 there began the process of going through the parts 7 of the crimes, particular points and the things that 8 would convince me that he was telling the truth. 9 Q Okay, now, that was - - 10 A Pardon me? 11 Q If I'm not mistaken, the first version was Dupard and 12 Calcagno did it with a second and third person? 13 Then, the second version was that he said he was 14 the shooter. Was there another version after that? 15 A The second version -- the first version was Dupard and 16 4 on the floor and let Reginald show you what happened? 5 A I would assume -- was it me saying that? Cause I -- if it was- 6 7 Adams was the one who asked him to lay on the ground. Maybe it wasn't picked up. If you think the tape was 8 stopped, that can be checked very easily.
