The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: At approximately 02:17 hrs, a c0mmotion was reported behind the premises of the Quick Stop on 5th Avenue. Officer Timothy Bradshaw responded to the scene and upon arrival, he encountered three individuals engaged in a heated argument. Officer Bradshaw proceeded to de-escalate the situation and questioned the individuals separately. Meanwhile, Sergeant Linda Matthews arrived at the location to provide backup. According to the report by Technician Jerry Thompson, who processed the scene later, there were signs of a possible scuffle, but no physical injuries were reported.During the initial questioning, Detective Sandra O'Reilly was summoned to the scene to lead the interrogation of a suspect who was found to be in possession of several questionable items. The suspect's belongings included what appeared to be stolen credit cards and a lock-picking kit. Detective O'Reilly took over the investigation, while Officer Bradshaw continued to secure the perimeter.In the course of the investigation, a vehicle parked nearby was identified as possibly being related to the disturbance. Patrol Officer Greg Daniels, who specializes in vehicle identification and recovery, was called in to examine the vehicle. His findings were inconclusive at the time, but the vehicle's VIN number was recorded for further investigation.Coroner Dr. Emily Stanton was briefly on site to assess the situation, ensuring that there were no fatalities or critical medical conditions that required her attention. After confirming there were no casualties, she left the scene.The ensuing investigation was documented thoroughly by Criminalist Mark Franklin, who collected fingerprints from the vehicle and surrounding area. He also documented the scene with photographs and collected various samples for analysis. The results of the analysis are pending, but preliminary observations suggested that the individuals involved may have been attempting to flee after committing a nearby burglary.The report concludes with a note stating that further follow-ups will be conducted by Detective O'Reilly and her team, with assistance from Officer Bradshaw and Technician Thompson as needed."
