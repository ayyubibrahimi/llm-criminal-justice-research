Rattled, she dialed from her landline, number 55-3841, to the Hilltown Sheriff's Department. Not knowing What category it fell into, they registered her complaint under item 16-7890-02, denoting the vague descriptor: 23:15 - Suspicious Activity. For Identification purposes, the confusingly tagged code 87612 - UNCLEAR was given.  Detective J. Robbins, while finishing some Donuts with Detective Sergeant Farrow, headed to the said address. Robbins' first remark upon observing the scene was about the footprints, Odd Shoe size, but clear Tread.  Technical expert, Miss Dana Craig, from the Crime Scene Division, was On the scene faster than the Detectives thought possible. Around 9:20 AM, she managed to lift a rather Smudged fingerprint from the shed's handle. A crumpled note, with the scribble Meet at dusk, was found under a spade.  Mr. Richard Wallis, a Neighbor from 1984 CherryBloom, approached Robbins. Last night, A figure. Can't say who. Dark clothes, Tall-ish? Might've seen them near Clara's fence. Not Sure, though, he offered.  Using this Confusing array of clues, by 4 PM, the investigative team was led towards a local handyman, Tom Gregory, known to have worked at several homes in Hilltown. His shoe size? An odd match. Further investigation became IMPERATIVE.  Taking Wallis' shaky account, the fingerprint which was yet to give a definite Match, and the odd note from the shed, the incident spiraled into a series of question marks, prompting a more In-depth look into Tom Gregory's recent activities."
