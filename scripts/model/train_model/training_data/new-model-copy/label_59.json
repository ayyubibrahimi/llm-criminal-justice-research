Liam Barnes, a marine archaeologist, spoke of the Ecliptic Dream once before in 1978, suggesting a link to ancient mariners and otherworldly expeditions.  Grace Stevens, last seen near the dock, whispered tales of sailors returning as ghosts, their stories lost to the sea. Hale's notes from 23 July 24 hinted at the boat\u2019s ethereal nature, Every wave holds a tale. But in these waters, tales drown only to resurface."
