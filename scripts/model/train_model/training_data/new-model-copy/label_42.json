The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: On 13 May 2023, Detective Sanders and Detective Lieutenant Carson made their way to Green Cafe, 45 Chestnut Avenue, at roughly 2:20 PM. The weather was cloudy, with the temperature in the low sixties degrees Fahrenheit.  Upon their arrival, Technician Ronald Parker from the West County Sheriff's Crime Scene Division was examining the area. Technician Parker photographed the cafe's interior and exterior. He also gathered unknown fingerprints from the counter near the cash register and collected video footage from the cafe's security cameras.  Detective Sanders then interviewed several witnesses present at the time of the robbery. Mrs. Martha Alcott, a regular patron, described a tall male suspect, approximately 6 feet in height, wearing a black hoodie and a ski mask. The suspect was reportedly seen fleeing the scene on foot, heading north.  On 20 May 2023, Detective Sanders received a call from Officer Jenna Smith, who mentioned stopping a male matching the suspect's description near Elm Street on the day of the robbery. A ski mask and a knife were found in his backpack.  On 22 May 2023, around 10:30 AM, Detective Sanders organized a line-up for Mr. Martinez at the Criminal Investigations Division. Mr. Martinez was shown a photographic line-up comprising six grayscale driver's license photos of white male subjects, including one of a man named Peter Connolly. Mr. Martinez immediately identified Connolly as the individual who had committed the armed robbery.  The line-up, witnessed by Attorney Grace Thompson, was photographed by Technician Ronald Parker at about 11:15 AM, the same day.  A copy of the witness report, the line-up log, and the confirmed identification form are appended to this report and are to be considered part of this document."
