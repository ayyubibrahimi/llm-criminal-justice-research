The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: In the midst of an ongoing investigation into a series of burglaries in the downtown area, Detective Marissa Connors reviewed the security footage provided by local businesses. It was during this scrutiny that she noticed a peculiar pattern. Every incident occurred within minutes of a black Sedan leaving the vicinity. Meanwhile, Sergeant Pete Molina had been canvassing the neighborhood and discovered that a similar vehicle had been reported by several residents. He relayed this information to Lieutenant Harvey, who then coordinated with the nearby precincts to alert them about the possible suspect vehicle. Officer Becca James, while on patrol, received the update and kept an eye out for the Sedan. Her vigilance paid off when she spotted the car parked outside a convenience store. As she called it in, Deputy Ryan Fisher arrived to provide backup. They approached the vehicle and found it empty but with evidence of stolen goods in the backseat. Technician Alex Monroe was called to the scene to collect fingerprints from the car, and Criminalist Dr. Jenna Walsh later analyzed them in the lab. The prints matched those of a known suspect, one Daniel Kretchmer, whose MO matched the burglaries. Coroner Dr. Samuel Hayes was also on duty that night, attending to an unrelated case, but his expertise in forensics proved useful in corroborating the time frame of the burglaries. The collaborative effort eventually led to the arrest of Kretchmer and a significant reduction in thefts in the area."
