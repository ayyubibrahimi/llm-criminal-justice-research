Technician Muhammad collected evidence at the scene. Sergeant McMullen briefed Detective Morton on the blood trail. Detective Aucoin secured the residence after collecting key evidence. Crime Lab Technician Tamika Rogers performed tests on the witnesses. Detective David Trehan's records indicated the nature of the deaths. Detective Morton and Orlando Mathews conducted interviews and reviewed the incident. Officer Gary Sallienger sketched the scene.
