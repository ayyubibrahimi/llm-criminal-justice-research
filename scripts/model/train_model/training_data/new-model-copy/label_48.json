Blackburn received a call regarding a potential break-in at 456 Pinegrove Lane. The homeowner, Ms. Natalie Spencer, telephoned from 44-9193 to report the incident. On arriving at the Northend Sheriff's Department, item number 16-0542-97 was created for the case, marking the offense as 17:50 - Residential Burglary. The identification for the ongoing investigation was designated as 102345 - AMBIGUOUS.  Detective Blackburn, teaming with Detective Sergeant Stone, arrived at Spencer's residence around 2:15 PM. As they approached, they noticed the backdoor was ajar. Inside, the living area was in disarray with furniture overturned and items scattered about.  As Detective Blackburn took statements, Technician Amy Foster of the Forensic Group was brought in to collect evidence. Around 3:30 PM, she confirmed fingerprints on a glass window and footprints in the backyard. A silver bracelet, presumably left behind by the intruder, was also retrieved.  Neighbor Mr. Harold Jones, residing at 458 Pinegrove Lane, came forward with a statement. He mentioned seeing an unfamiliar tall individual, wearing a black hoodie and red sneakers, lingering near the premises the previous night.  Around 6:00 PM, the gathered evidence directed the investigation towards a suspect, identified as Jake Winters, a previously convicted felon with a history of burglaries.  Combining Ms. Spencer's testimony, the forensic data, and the neighbor's account, the case file began to shape. It was clear that a thorough search for Jake Winters was necessary to progress the investigation."
