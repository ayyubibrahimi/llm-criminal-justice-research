The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: At approximately 0h3O hrs, Det3ctive Smith along with Serg3ant Johnson responded to a 10-54 at 42nd street. Upon arrival, they found the vicTim lying face down. Whilst examining the scene, OfF1cer Daniels reported that the vide0 surveillance nearby might have caught the perpetrator. Techn!cian Harper was then tasked to retrieve the footage and examine it for any clues. Lat3r, Captain Reynolds was briefed about the situation, and he ordered a city-wide search for the suspect, described as wearing a blue hoodie and dark jeans. Meanwhile, Dr. Hennings at the morgue conf1rmed that the cause of death was a single gunshot wound to the back. In an unexpected turn of events, Deputy Miller recalled seeing an individual matching the suspect's description near the 34th boulevard earlier that night. Cr1minalist Parker and his team collected samples from the scene to analyze for DNA evidence, hoping it would lead them to the suspect."
