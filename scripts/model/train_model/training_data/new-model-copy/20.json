Officer Gonzalez, on surveillance duty in Venice, was the first to report suspicious drug-related activities. Assisting her were Sgt. Michelle Rodriguez and Patrol Officer Martinez, who swiftly coordinated a containment strategy. Technician Smith, an expert in narcotic analysis, was assigned to examine the seized substances. Criminalist Edwards, delving into the forensic evidence, discovered distinct drug signatures that were key in identifying the suppliers.
