The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: During the late-night investigation, it was Sergeant O'Neal who first noticed an anomaly at the scene. The front door seemed tampered with, but not in the usual manner intruders employ. Further examination by Technician Harper revealed fiber traces consistent with a heavy-duty jacket, suggesting our perpetrator had a background in security or law enforcement. Meanwhile, Deputy Clarkson was securing the perimeter when Officer Davis arrived with K-9 unit R0c0. R0c0's keen sense picked up a scent leading to a nearby alleyway where Officer Griggs found discarded items belonging to the victim. Detective Carson, who had been meticulously reviewing the surveillance footage, called Lieutenant Morrison over to point out a suspicious figure who appeared to match the description of a person of interest named in a previous report by Coroner Dr. Simmons. Dr. Simmons' autopsy findings indicated the victim suffered injuries that could not have been self-inflicted."
