The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: In the early hours of the morning, Detective Marissa O'Connell and her partner, Sergeant Jack Brennan, arrived at the chaotic crime scene. The front door had been smashed in, evidencing a forced entry. As they moved deeper into the residence, they noted multiple signs of struggle. Officer Mateo Ramirez was already on the scene, taking statements from the visibly shaken neighbors. Technician Emily Watson was crouched over a shattered lamp, meticulously collecting potential fingerprints, while Patrol Officer George Clark directed the gathering crowd away from the area. Meanwhile, Deputy Coroner Dr. Samuel Hayes was examining the body, declaring time of death to be approximately 2 hours prior to their arrival. In an adjacent room, Criminalist Dr. Henry Liu was analyzing blood spatter patterns. The situation was further complicated when a call came over the radio from Officer Jane Phillips, who reported that a suspicious individual had been spotted fleeing the area shortly after the incident. A second team, including Lieutenant Cara Stevens and Captain Rick Donovan, was dispatched to assist in a search of the vicinity. As the investigation continued, Technician Mark Roberts arrived to assist Watson with the collection of evidence. Coroner's Assistant Dr. Naomi Fisher was seen discussing the preliminary findings with Dr. Hayes. At the corner, Officer Miguel Santos was taking notes, and close by, the seasoned Criminalist Dr. Erica Johnson was piecing together the sequence of events that led to the untimely demise."
