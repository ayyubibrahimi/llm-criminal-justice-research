The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: Dur1ng the early m0rning h0urs of the investigati0n, it was rep0rted that a susp1cious individual was seen leav1ng the area. Officer Terrence McD0well, who was on night patrol, was dispatched to the scene. Upon arr1val, Officer McD0well and his partner, Patrol Officer Linda Juarez, quickly sec0red the area and began canvassing for any potential witnesses. Meanwhile, Detective Jameson O'Conner, along with his colleague Detective Andrea L1vetti, took the lead on the case. Their efforts were supported by Sergeant Elijah Moreno who coordinated the broader search operations, including setting up checkpoints and gathering surveillance footage from nearby establishments. Crime lab Technician Emily Sanchez was called to process the scene for forensic evidence. She was later joined by Coroner Dr. Henry Kim, who examined the body for the preliminary cause of death. The two worked meticulously, often cross-referencing details with Criminalist Dr. Rachel Abrams, who specialized in blood pattern analysis. As the day progressed, Lieutenant Marcus Trenton briefed the press on the developments and reiterated the department's commitment to solving the case swiftly. Captain Geraldine Herrera monitored the progress from the central command, ensuring all units were functioning cohesively. Deputy Chief Nathanial Briggs was overseeing the entire operation, making sure resources were allocated effectively to aid the investigation."
