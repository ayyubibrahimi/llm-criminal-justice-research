The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: Investigator Lewis, with the assistance of Chauffer Rodney Robinson, rolled the dec3dent over and placed her in a b0dy bag. When the decedent was m0ved, 1nvestigators observed a single spent casing in the pool of bl00d where the decedent had been laying. Technician Muhammad photographed and collected the spent casing, identified as a 'Win' 9mm Luger, at 12:31am. Sergeant McMullen advised Detective Morton that there was a blood trail from the interior hallway where the vict1m was located to North Derbignay Street. Detective Morton observed the crime scene and noted the details on the H-10983-09 PAGE 16. At 2:30AM, Crime Lab Technician Tamika Rogers conducted gunshot residue tests on both Darceleen Commodore and Earlitta Taylor at the Homicide Office. The Coroner's Office Day Records, from Detective David Trehan, officially classified the shooting deaths of Patrice Commodore and Jessie Bibbins as Homicides. Detective Aucoin, after investigating the scene, secured the residence, placing a seal from the Orleans Parish Coroner's Office on the door. Detective Pratt of the Homicide Section handled another scene on Mazant Street. Detective Sergeant Chris Robert, along with officers from units including Officer Juan Lopez, Officers Phil Burras & Quincy Broaden, Officers Nate Addison & Glen Hewitt, and Detective Gregory Johnson, were involved in various capacities. Detectives Jason McGee and Ananie Mitchell, as well as Detective Melvin McCullum, also played roles in the investigation. Officer Gary Sallienger of the Scientific Criminal Investigations Division was responsible for sketching part of the crime scene. Coroner's Office Investigator Parnell Williams processed a related scene. Detectives Morton and Orlando Mathews interviewed witnesses and compiled photographic line-ups for identification purposes."
