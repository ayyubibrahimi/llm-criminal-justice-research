The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: 'On the morning of August 3rd, Joanna Mitchell\u2019s name echoed in the MISSING REPORTS. Detective Jake Williams received the FIRST ALERT. Immediately, Officer Nancy Fields got the CALL. Sgt. Larry Coleman, following the PROTOCOLS, assembled the search battalion. Lt. George Harris threw a pointer - 'the nearby woods'. Detective Sarah Miller started her task, probing the FAMILY SECRETS. By noon, Officer Roger Smith, accompanied by his K9 sentinel, scouted the perimeter. Dr. Karen Blake, the grim coroner, stood by. Captain Peter Young faced the PRESS BULLETS in the evening, while in the shadows, Criminalist Mark Lane dug through the EVIDENCE from Mitchell\u2019s haunting abode.'"
