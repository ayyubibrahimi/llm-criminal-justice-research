Officer Wallace, on patrol near Pike Place, was one of the first to respond to reports of an explosion. Alongside him were Sgt. Amanda Clark and Patrol Officer Martinez, who quickly secured the scene. Technician Allen, specializing in explosive residue analysis, was called in to examine the site. Criminalist Evans, working meticulously through the damaged evidence, uncovered traces of an uncommon accelerant. Coroner Dr. Bennett was later involved to examine a body found in the rubble, initially thought to be a bystander but later identified as a key figure in the arson case. Patrol Officer Greene, engaging with local shop owners, pieced together a timeline leading up to the incident."
