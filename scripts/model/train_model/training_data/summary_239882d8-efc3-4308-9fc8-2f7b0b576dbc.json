            "content": "As an AI assistant, my role is to meticulously analyze criminal justice documents and extract information about law enforcement personnel. The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: Investigator Lewis and Chauffeur Rodney Robinson, who were on the scene by 12:31am, proceeded with the task of moving the dec1dent into a body bag. As they shifted the body, a single 9mm Luger casing was noticed beneath where the victim had been positioned. Technician Muhammad swiftly documented and gathered the evidence. Post this, Sergeant McMullen relayed to Detective Morton the existence of a blood trail spanning from the inner hallway to the street outside. Detective Morton then carried out a thorough review of the H-10983-09 case file. At approximately 2:30am, Crime Lab Technician Tamika Rogers executed GSR tests on the eyewitnesses, Darceleen Commodore and Earlitta Taylor, at the Homicide Office. The Coroner's Office, through Detective David Trehan, later confirmed the fatalities of Patrice Commodore and Jessie Bibbins as homicides. Detective Morton met with Darceleen Commodore at her residence around 9am, where she conveyed the pressure exerted by Reynell Payne to misidentify the assailant. Furthermore, Detective Aucoin discovered a set of keys in the living room which matched the front door, securing the premises post-investigation. Detective Morton received additional documentation, including audio logs and an incident report from the Fifth District, which supported his observations. During the late-night hours, Detective Ryan Aucoin directed the crime scene processing, ensuring evidence markers were placed along the blood trail and a segment of the doorway was sketched into the scene by Officer Gary Sallienger. Units responded, manned by Detective Sergeant Chris Robert, Officer Juan Lopez, Officers Phil Burras & Quincy Broaden, Officers Nate Addison & Glen Hewitt, Detective Gregory Johnson, Detective Jason McGee, Detective Ananie Mitchell, and Detective Melvin McCullum. Detective Mathews compiled photographic line-ups for witness identification, while Detective Morton interviewed additional eyewitnesses to corroborate the sequence of events."
