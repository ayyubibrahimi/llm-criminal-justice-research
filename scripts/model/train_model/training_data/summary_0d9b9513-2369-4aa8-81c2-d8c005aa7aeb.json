The response will contain: 1) The name of a law enforcement personnel. The individual's name must be prefixed with one of the following titles to be in law enforcement: Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy, Officer, Patrol Officer, Criminalist, Technician, Coroner, or Dr. Please prefix the name with 'Officer Name: '. I will derive this data from the following paragraph: At the scene, Detective Ryan Aucoin and his team began processing evidence. Among the items collected was a 'Wiin' 9mm Luger cartridge found by Technician Muhammad. The coroner, Dr. Lacey, pronounced the victim deceased at 01:23 AM. Sergeant McMullen was overseeing the operations, ensuring all procedures were adhered to. Detective Barret Morton questioned the witnesses, who recalled seeing a man matching suspect Kendall Gordon's description fleeing the area. Officer Juan Lopez secured the perimeter while Officer Phil Burras took statements from the bystanders. The case was becoming increasingly complex, as new evidence, including a partial fingerprint found on a broken window sill, was discovered by Criminalist Gary Sallienger. This new lead prompted Lieutenant Carson to instruct his team to re-canvass the neighborhood. Captain Elaine Briggs reviewed the case files and noted potential discrepancies in the timelines provided by the witnesses. Deputy Martin Shaw was tasked with checking all surveillance footage in the vicinity. Patrol Officer Lydia Grant reported that a suspicious vehicle had been seen in the area at the time of the incident. Technician Emily Watson analyzed the ballistic evidence and confirmed that the 9mm Luger cartridge was fired from the same weapon used in a previous crime. The precision of Coroner Dr. Lacey's examination helped narrow down the time of death, which was crucial for establishing a timeline. Criminalist Gary Sallienger's expertise in fingerprint analysis was instrumental in identifying the partial print, which belonged to a known associate of Gordon."
