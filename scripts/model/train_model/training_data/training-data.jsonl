And, I may add, it was at Mr. Adams' 4 request. I'd a perferred to tape the entire thing. Q 5 9 10 tape recorder as to how he was laying or where Mr. 11 Adams was pointing, did he? I don't think it was important. Mr. Adams was on our A 12 13 direction.

A 16 Well, why did Officer Ruiz call you out to interview Q 17 Reginald Adams about the murder case? 18 I had received information in February of eighty, in A 19 April of eighty and in August of eighty concerning 20 Mr. Adams being the murderer of Kathy Ulfers. I was 21 aware in August of eighty that he was also a suspect 22 that was going to be arrested for the burglary of 23 Seafood City. Two parties that he was involved with 24 A 1 Little was there and the three inmates were there 2 when I arrived. 5 Q So, Ursin called you? 4 A Yes, sir. 5 Q Do you know if he had been conducting any conversation 6 with Mr. Ruiz -- Mr. Reginald Adams? 7 I don't think so, because our theory was to question him A 8 at the same time, to be fully present at the same 9 time. My appreciation of why I was called is that 10 Mr. Adams had indicated a desire to confess and to 11 implicate Calcagno and Dupard in the Seafood City 12 17 A Mr. Rowan, I can't remember everything. I know there was 18 cash stolen, there was guns stolen, there was a 19 T. V. stolen and I believe there was a typewriter 20 stolen and a policeman's jacket was stolen and a police 21 radio was stolen. That's all I can remember right 22 now off the top of my head. 23 And, was he able to show you the areas where they were 0 24 taken? 25 A Yes, sir. Everything he showed me coincided perfectly with 26 what happened. 27 - Q Q 13 Well, I think about an hour. I believe. Maybe less. A 14 Q Did you personally give him his rights or did you know 15 that Officer Ruiz had given them to him before you 16 17 got there? Officer Ruiz, to my knowledge did not speak to Adams 18 until I arrived and after I arrived there, we went 19 into a conference room in the -- there's a big office 20 in Parish Prison. It's an investigator's office 21 used by the sheriff's department and there's a room 22 12 burglary and word was sent down through the tier 13 reps, Freddie Cannon and Irving Anderson. Sargent 14 Little in turn notified either Ruiz or Ursin. Ruiz 15 was notified and Ruiz instructed Ursin to notify me 16 17 and that's how I got there. Now, you were there from 11:30. You got the call about Q 18 19 when, 10: 30? A Around 10:30. 20 Q So, Mr. Adams was in that room ready to talk to somebody 21 at least from 10:30 on; is that correct? 22 I would guess, sir. I -- A 23 6 there began the process of going through the parts 7 of the crimes, particular points and the things that 8 would convince me that he was telling the truth. 9 Q Okay, now, that was - - 10 A Pardon me? 11 Q If I'm not mistaken, the first version was Dupard and 12 Calcagno did it with a second and third person? 13 Then, the second version was that he said he was 14 the shooter. Was there another version after that? 15 A The second version -- the first version was Dupard and 16 4 on the floor and let Reginald show you what happened? 5 A I would assume -- was it me saying that? Cause I -- if it was- 6 7 Adams was the one who asked him to lay on the ground. Maybe it wasn't picked up. If you think the tape was 8 stopped, that can be checked very easily. The tape 9 10 was never stopped. That can be checked so easily 11 it's ridculous. Anyone can check that. It was never 12 stopped. That's simple. Q Now, Officer, at some point in time that night, you showed 13 14 114 the victim, Kathy Ulfers in relation to himself. Okay, and in whose direction was that done? Q 2 Mr. Adams.

Not Sure, though, he offered.  Using this Confusing array of clues, by 4 PM, the investigative team was led towards a local handyman, Tom Gregory, known to have worked at several homes in Hilltown. His shoe size? An odd match. Further investigation became IMPERATIVE.

Accompanyed by Chauffer Rodney Robinson, they proceeded to move the decedent's body into a body bag. Subsequently, a single spent casing was found in the pool of bl00d where the body had been. Technician Muh4mmad documented and collected the casing, later identified as a 'Win' 9mm Luger. The incident, a home invasion, left two eyewitnesses, Darceleen Commodore and Earlitta Taylor, inside at the t!me of the shooting. Sergeant McMullen briefed Detective M0rton on a blood trail leading from the hallway to North Derbignay Street. Detective Morton noted the trail, then entered the bedroom to find a woman unresponsive and bleeding on the floor. The witness reported that Gordon threatened her life if the police arrived. Both intruders fled without taking any valuables. At approximately 2:30AM, Crime Lab Technician Tamika Rogers performed a gunshot residue test on both witnesses at the Homicide Office. The Coroner's Office, through Detective David Trehan, l4belled the deaths of Patrice Commodore and Jessie Bibbins as homicides. Detective Morton followed up with Darceleen Commodore at 9:00AM, discussing her encounter with Reynell Payne. Commodore was pressured by Payne to state her son was not involved and to blame an older individual. Detective Morton and Orlando Mathews conducted interviews at the Homicide Office. They compiled photographic line-ups of the suspects, which were presented to the witnesses. Detective Morton also received relevant documents, including a crime scene report containing photographs, a scene sketch, and evidence receipts.

Officer N4ncy Drew, a specialist in explosive ordnance disposal, was summoned to assess the threat. After a thorough examination, Officer Drew determined the device to be a rudimentary fake. In the meantime, Technician L1nda B4r0n documented the scene and collected potential evidence, including a suspi6ious package found near the entrance. Further investigation by Detective J0nathan D0e revealed that the suspect, known to the community as 'Crazy Joe', had a history of similar hoaxes.

Officer Don Matthews and Officer Mia Sanchez arrived as backup, with Officer Matthews securing the scene and Officer Sanchez attending to the neighbors' queries. According to the neighbors, Mr. Hensley has a history of erratic behavior, often shouting at 'phantoms' as one neighbor put it. The situation escalated when Mr. Hensley brandished what appeared to be a firearm. Sgt. Price attempted to de-escalate the situation, but Mr. Hensley became more agitated. It was then that Officer Sanchez noticed the weapon was in fact a pellet gun. With this knowledge, Det. O'Conner managed to calm Mr. Hensley down, and he was taken into custody without further incident. A subsequent search by Technician Emily Nguyen revealed the pellet gun and multiple empty liquor bottles. The firearm was logged into evidence by Crmnlst. Lucas Graham, who was later called to process the evidence. Coroner Dr. Henry Wallace was briefly on scene to confirm there were no injuries.

Technician Muhammad, despite the faint lighting, managed to photograph and secure the casing labeled as a 'Win' 9mm Luger. The incident, which occured at around 11:45pm, involved two key eyewitnesses within the domicile during the events, Darceleen Commodore and Earlitta Taylor. Sergeant McMullen relayed to Detective Morton that a blood trail was evident from the interior hallway to North Derbigny Street. Upon rev1ewing the H-10983-09 report, Detective Morton noted the witness's account of the intruder's threat to commit homicide if law enforcers were to arrive. Subsequently, the offenders fled the premises with neither monetary gains nor vehicular access. The law enforcement's follow-up included Crime Lab Technician Tamika Rogers performing GSR tests on both witnesses at the Homicide Office. Furthermore, Detective David Trehan's records from the Coroner's Office denoted the demises of Patrice Commodore and Jessie Bibbins as homicides. When confronted by Detective Morton, Darceleen Commodore identified Reynell Payne under duress as a non-participant in the events, contrary to her initial assertion. Additional interviews at the Homicide Office by Detective Morton with eyewitnesses yielded a positive identification of Kendall Gordon as one of the assailants by Commodore, who was around 90% certain of her recognition. Detective Aucoin, around 1:00am, pinpointed a set of keys within the lounge area, later securing the residence post-investigation. The subsequent day involved Detective Morton obtaining communication logs pertinent to the case. In the same vein, a comprehensive Crime Scene Report inclusive of photographs, a scene sketch, and evidence catalog was received from the Crime Lab. The processing of the crime scene was executed under the direction of Detective Ryan Aucoin, with evidence markers placed strategically and a broken doorjamb piece sketched into the scene illustration by SciCrim Inv Division Officer Gary Sallienger.

I will derive this data from the following paragraph: At a crime scene on 4th and Maple, it was a cold and rainy night, a typical setting where you expect the unexpected to happen. Sergeant O'Malley was the first to arrive, noticing the scattered debris and the faint sound of a car alarm in the distance. The streetlights were flickering, casting an eerie glow on the scene. Officer Reynolds and Officer Clark were next, securing the perimeter with yellow tape, their breaths visible in the chilling air. Meanwhile, Technician Harper was examining the car wreckage, looking for any signs of the driver or potential evidence. Just as Harper found a peculiarly bent license plate, Lieutenant Carter approached, his boots splashing in the puddles that pockmarked the road. 'Any luck?' he inquired, but before Harper could answer, Detective M0ran0's voice crackled over the radio. 'We have a witness,' she said, her tone indicating she was on the move. 'They saw a red sedan speeding away.' Back at the precinct, Criminalist Jensen was meticulously piecing together the information collected, while Coroner Dr. Price was examining the unfortunate victim who was found several blocks away, a likely hit and run. Captain Ruiz had been overseeing the operations, ensuring every detail was attended to. Suddenly, the radio buzzed again, Patrol Officer L0pez reported spotting a red sedan with a dent on the hood that matched the bent license plate found at the scene. The night was far from over, but the pieces were starting to come together, thanks to the concerted efforts of the law enforcement team."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Identify each individual in the transcript, by name, who are directly referred to as officers, sergeants, lieutenants, captains, detectives, homicide officers, and crime lab personnel."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Officer Name: Sergeant O'MalleyOfficer Context: First responder at the crime scene on 4th and Maple.Officer Role: SergeantOfficer Name: Officer ReynoldsOfficer Context: Assisted in securing the perimeter with yellow tape.Officer Role: Police OfficerOfficer Name: Officer ClarkOfficer Context: Assisted in securing the perimeter with yellow tape.Officer Role: Police OfficerOfficer Name: Technician HarperOfficer Context: Examined the car wreckage at the scene.Officer Role: TechnicianOfficer Name: Lieutenant CarterOfficer Context: Approached Technician Harper to inquire about findings at the crime scene.Officer Role: LieutenantOfficer Name: Detective Moran0Officer Context: Reported over the radio about a witness sighting a red sedan speeding away.Officer Role: DetectiveOfficer Name: Criminalist JensenOfficer Context: Was piecing together information collected from the crime scene.Officer Role: CriminalistOfficer Name: Dr. PriceOfficer Context: Examining the victim of a likely hit and run.Officer Role: CoronerOfficer Name: Captain RuizOfficer Context: Overseeing the operations at the crime scene.Officer Role: CaptainOfficer Name: Patrol Officer LopezOfficer Context: Reported spotting a red sedan that matched evidence from the crime scene.Officer Role: Patrol Officer"}]}
