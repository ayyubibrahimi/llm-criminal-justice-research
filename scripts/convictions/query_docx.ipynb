And, I may add, it was at Mr. Adams\\'\\n4\\nrequest. I\\'d a perferred to tape the entire thing.\\nQ\\n5\\nNow, during the time prior to 4:50, he gave you various\\n6\\nstatements; is that correct?\\n7\\nA\\nConcerning the murder case?\\n8\\nYes.\\nQ\\nA\\n9\\nYes, sir, he gave me three -- three of different types of\\n10\\nstatements. It\\'s hard to answer the question. In\\n11\\nother words, as he would tell the story, he would\\n12\\nget more and more detailed into it.\\n13\\nWell, you used the word \"different types,\" the wording.\\nQ\\n14', metadata={'source': '../../data/convictions/transcripts\\\\(D) Det.

I had a lot of street talks, several\\n12\\ndifferent sources, but no direct, strong evidence.\\n13\\nYou had not charged Mr. Adams or Mr. Dupard or Mr. Calcagno\\nQ\\n14\\nwith that murder?\\n15\\nNo, sir.\\n16\\nAnd, none of those three people had -- you had not made an\\nQ\\n17\\nattempt to talk to any of those three people\\n18\\n19\\npersonally?\\nA\\nThat's correct.\\n20\\nAnd, at the time you got there, eleven o'clock would be\\nQ\\n21\\nsafe to say?\\n22\\nA\\nI would be safe 11:30.\\n23\\nQ\\nOkay. 11:30.

My appreciation of why I was called is that\\n10\\nMr. Adams had indicated a desire to confess and to\\n11\\nimplicate Calcagno and Dupard in the Seafood City\\n12\\nburglary and word was sent down through the tier\\n13\\nreps, Freddie Cannon and Irving Anderson.

Further test-\\n25\\ning of the seminal fluid stains that\\n24\\nshorts, what we do\\nI found in the\\n25\\nis called a secreter test. The se-\\n20\\ncreter test is used to determine a\\nperson's blood type from his bodily\\n28\\nsecretions. What that is is 80 percent\\n29\\nof the population is a secreter.
