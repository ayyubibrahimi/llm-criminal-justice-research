# LLM-Criminal-Justice-Research

This repository contains a novel approach to extracting and analyzing data from trial transcripts using OpenAI's large language models (LLMs). Our focus is on identifying and interpreting information about law enforcement personnel, including those working in homicide and crime labs. The project uses an LLM to understand the trial transcripts and respond to specific queries.
